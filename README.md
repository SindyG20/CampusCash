# CampusCash
Campus Cash Bank is a specialized banking website exclusively serving students at the North-West University. The bank provides essential financial services such as account management, transaction processing, and financial aid disbursement. The bank aims to enhance its digital banking experience while ensuring secure transactions and seamless service delivery. However, the current banking system faces several challenges that hinder its efficiency and accessibility. These issues include security concerns, outdated application infrastructure, limited capacity for handling student accounts, and the need for an appointment-based booking system to reduce physical congestion. Addressing these problems will improve the overall banking experience, ensuring that students can efficiently manage their financial needs.
